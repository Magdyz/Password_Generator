Password Generator is a website that creates strong passwords with a mixture of symbols, numbers and caps. It also has the posibility of adding a memorable word to the password. 

It is based on HTML, CSS and Javascript for the logic. 

I have added clear comments and the project is open source so feel free to use the code with attribution.
